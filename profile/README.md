## Our mission: Driving the digital change in plant science

DataPLANT‚Äôs mission is to provide a sustainable and well annotated data management platform for plant sciences. 
DataPLANT will pave the way from classical paper publication to pure data publication including the **Annotated Research Context (ARC)**

## The community
DataPlant is primarily geared towards the needs of fundamental plant research (e.g. those represented by the DFG 
categories 202-[01 evolution and systematics of plants and animals, 04 plant physiology, 05 plant biochemistry and biophysics, 06 plant cell and developmental biology, 07 plant genetics]. 
As such DataPlant is especially adapter to large scale data sets be it omics science or imaging and is ready to store petabaytes of annotated data.

## The Annotated Research Context (ARC)

DataPlant will allow users to store their data in form of an annotated research context. 
This includes not only the measurement data, but also (meta)data annotations, tools, and scripts. 
This will allow reproducibility plus to forward ‚Äúraw data‚Äù and metadata slices to public repositories (e.g. EBI NCBI etc.).
